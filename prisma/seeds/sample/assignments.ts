**Requirements:**
1. Grind the same coffee beans at 3 different sizes: coarse, medium, fine
2. Take photos of each grind consistency
3. Brew each grind using the same method (pour-over recommended)
4. Document taste differences and extraction times
5. Write a 300-word reflection on how grind size affected your coffee

**Submission Format:**
- Upload photos of each grind size
- Include brewing notes and tasting observations
- Submit written reflection as PDF or text

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Demonstration of different grind sizes (30 points)
- Quality of brewing observations (35 points)  
- Reflection depth and insights (35 points)`,

**Materials Needed:**
- 3 different single-origin coffees (provided recommendations in lesson)
- Cupping spoons or tasting spoons
- Cupping forms (downloadable from lesson resources)
- Timer

**Assignment Steps:**
1. Set up a proper cupping session following lesson guidelines
2. Evaluate each coffee using the SCA cupping protocol
3. Complete cupping forms for all three coffees
4. Identify flavor notes using the coffee flavor wheel
5. Rank the coffees by preference and justify your choices

**Deliverables:**
- Completed cupping forms (scanned or photos)
- Written comparison analysis (500-700 words)
- Flavor wheel annotations for each coffee

**Grading Rubric:**
- Proper cupping technique demonstration (25 points)
- Accuracy of flavor identification (25 points)
- Quality of comparative analysis (25 points)
- Use of coffee terminology (25 points)`,
